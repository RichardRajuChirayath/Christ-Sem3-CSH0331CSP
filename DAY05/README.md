        <h2>1. SSH (Secure Shell)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>SSH</strong> is a network protocol used to establish a secure, encrypted connection
          between two computers over an unsecured network, such as the internet. It allows users to
          securely log into a remote machine, execute commands, transfer files, and manage devices
          remotely by encrypting all data exchanged during the session.

        <h2>3. Privilege Escalation</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Privilege escalation</strong> is a cyberattack technique where an attacker gains
          unauthorized elevated access or privileges on a system beyond what is initially granted.
          This allows the attacker to increase control, steal sensitive data, install malware, or
          further infiltrate the network.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Privilege Escalation</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Vertical Privilege Escalation:</strong> Moving from a lower privilege level to a higher one,
          such as from a normal user to an administrator. Often achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities,
          misconfigurations, or bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Horizontal Privilege Escalation:</strong> Accessing the privileges of another user with the
          same privilege level, often to impersonate that user or move laterally in the system.
