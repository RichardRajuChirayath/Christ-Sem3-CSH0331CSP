## network
A network is a group of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other to share resources and information.

---

## subnet

---

## MAC address
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) for communication on the physical network segment.

## IP address (static and dynamic) â€” IPv4 and IPv6
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network.
- **Static IP address:** Remains constant and does not change over time.
- **Dynamic IP address:** Assigned by a DHCP server and can change over time.
- **IPv4:** 32-bit address format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **IPv6:** 128-bit address format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
