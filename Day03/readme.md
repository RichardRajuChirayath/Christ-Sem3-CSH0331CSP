In Day 03 i learnt about the following details which are given below:-


- Conducting static and dynamic analysis
Static Analysis
Static analysis is examining code or files without executing them to find malware or vulnerabilities.
For example, analyzing a suspicious .exe file's code to find hardcoded IP addresses or encryption logic using Ghidra.
It helps detect threats early but may miss behaviors that occur only when the file runs.

Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis means executing a file in a sandbox to observe real behavior like network activity or system changes.
For example, running malware in Cuckoo Sandbox to see if it sends data to a command-and-control server.
It gives deeper insights into actual threats but is riskier if not done in isolation.

Example: `/home/kali`  

In this path, the first slash represents the root directory, and the second slash indicates a subdirectory. In this case, "kali" refers to the user directory.  

- To create an empty file, use the command `touch`.  
- Can access the manual by using the command `man ls`.  
- The command `pwd` displays the path of the current working directory. 

-chmod command
