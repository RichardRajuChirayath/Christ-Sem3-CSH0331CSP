In Day 03 i learnt about the following details which are given below:-
- Install VS Code in Kali Linux  
- Cloning a specific repository  
- Attempting to penetrate Windows 11  
- Conducting static and dynamic analysis  

Example: `/home/kali`  

In this path, the first slash represents the root directory, and the second slash indicates a subdirectory. In this case, "kali" refers to the user directory.  

- To create an empty file, use the command `touch`.  
- Can access the manual by using the command `man ls`.  
- The command `pwd` displays the path of the current working directory.
